What is the VIP-box?

Understanding the intricate dynamics of gene expression, chemical signaling, and growth patterns within plant organs is a complex challenge that spans various scales, 
from macroscopic to cellular levels. Conventional microscope configurations often fall short of addressing this multifaceted issue, necessitating innovative solutions. 

To tackle this challenge, we present the VIP-box, an innovative and cost-effective open-source imaging platform designed specifically for capturing the vertical growth 
of seedlings using epifluorescence microscopy. To facilitate rigorous quantitative analysis, we present two image analysis pipelines developed to extract both fluorescence signals 
and growth pattern maps. The validation of the VIP-box demonstrates its effectiveness in unravelling the intricate influence of apoplastic pH on growth patterns within plant organs. 

Our versatile platform accelerates the simultaneous and high-throughput imaging of multiple fluorescent markers across diverse genetic backgrounds. 
The modularity of our system enhances its adaptability, allowing it to be deployed across a broad spectrum of plant species. 
By facilitating simultaneous analyses under different conditions, our platform could contribute to a more comprehensive exploration of the factors influencing plant morphogenesis.
